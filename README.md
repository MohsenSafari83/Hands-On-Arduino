# Hands-On in Arduino

Welcome to my **Arduino Projects Repository**!  
This repository is a documentation of my hands-on journey into the world of **embedded systems** using **Arduino**. What began as a curiosity to understand how electronics work has transformed into a passion to build real-world applications—from simple LED blinking to complex systems like automatic doors and communication protocols.

The purpose of this repo is to take you from the **fundamentals of microcontroller programming** to **real-world applications**. Each project is designed to help you understand key concepts while building something practical, laying the foundation for future projects in **electronics**, **IoT**, and **robotics**.

As I continue my journey, new projects and resources will be added to expand on concepts and explore new areas of electronics. Let’s get started and build something amazing!
