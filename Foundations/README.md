# Arduino Foundations

Welcome to the **Foundations** section of the *Hands-on Arduino* learning journey!  
Here you'll find the **core concepts** and **fundamental experiments** that build the groundwork for all future Arduino projects.

These examples are inspired by [DeepBlueEmbedded’s Arduino Getting Started Guide](https://deepbluembedded.com/arduino-getting-started-beginners-guide/) and expanded with notes, code, and circuit diagrams.

## What You'll Learn

By going through the exercises in this folder, you will learn how to:

- Set up the Arduino IDE and board connections  
- Understand digital I/O (inputs and outputs)  
- Use analog input and output (PWM)  
- Read data from basic sensors (e.g. LDR, potentiometer)  
- Communicate through the Serial Monitor  
- Combine simple concepts into mini experiments

##  Learning Flow

| Step | Concept | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| 1️ | **LED Blink** | Your very first Arduino program — understanding `pinMode()`, `digitalWrite()`, and `delay()` |
| 2️ | **Digital Inputs** | Learn how to use buttons and switches to trigger events |
| 3️ | **Analog Inputs** | Read varying sensor values with `analogRead()` |
| 4️ | **PWM Output** | Control brightness or motor speed using `analogWrite()` |
| 5️ | **Serial Communication** | Send data to your computer for debugging and visualization |

##  Tools & Components

- Arduino Uno (or compatible board)  
- Breadboard & jumper wires  
- LEDs & resistors (220Ω–330Ω)  
- Push buttons  
- Potentiometer or LDR sensor  
- USB cable for uploading sketches

## Next Step

After finishing the Foundations section, move on to the [`projects/`](../projects/) folder to start building real-world Arduino applications.
