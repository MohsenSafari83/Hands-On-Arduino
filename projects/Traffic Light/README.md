# üö¶Arduino Traffic Light Project

A simple **traffic light simulation** built using an **Arduino Uno** and three LEDs (red, yellow, green).  
This project demonstrates basic digital output control and timing using the `digitalWrite()` and `delay()` functions in Arduino.

---

##  Overview

This mini-project simulates how a real traffic light operates:
1. The **green LED** turns on for a few seconds, allowing "traffic" to pass.  
2. Then the **yellow LED** turns on briefly to indicate a warning.  
3. Finally, the **red LED** turns on to stop traffic before the cycle repeats.

## Circuit Connection

| LED Color | Arduino Pin | Resistor | Ground |
|------------|--------------|-----------|--------|
| Red        | 12           | 220Œ©      | GND |
| Yellow     | 8            | 220Œ©      | GND |
| Green      | 5            | 220Œ©      | GND |

> ‚ö†Ô∏è The **long leg (anode)** of each LED goes to the **resistor ‚Üí Arduino pin**, and the **short leg (cathode)** goes to **GND**.
