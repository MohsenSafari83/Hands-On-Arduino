# Arduino Mini Projects Collection

This repository contains **three simple Arduino mini projects** designed to help beginners understand the fundamentals of electronics and programming.  
Each project introduces an essential concept: **sensor input**, **signal output**, and **PWM control**.  
Together, they form a foundation for learning how Arduino interacts with the physical world.

##  Project Goals

The purpose of these three projects is to:
- Understand how Arduino reads **analog sensor data** (temperature sensor)
- Learn how to generate **sound frequencies** using a buzzer
- Explore **Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)** to control LED brightness
- Visualize electronic signals with tools such as an **oscilloscope**
- Develop practical skills in building and testing circuits on a **breadboard**

## Project 1 â€” Temperature Sensor (LM35)

### Description
This project reads temperature data from an **LM35 sensor** and prints the temperature value in degrees Celsius (Â°C) on the Serial Monitor.

### How It Works
The LM35 outputs a voltage proportional to the temperature (10 mV per Â°C).  
Arduino reads this voltage through its **analog input pin** and converts it into a temperature value using a simple formula.

### Circuit Connections
- **LM35 VCC (Pin 1)** â†’ 5V on Arduino  
- **LM35 Output (Pin 2)** â†’ A5 (analog input)  
- **LM35 GND (Pin 3)** â†’ GND on Arduino  

A jumper wire connects each pin properly to the Arduino board and breadboard.

### What Youâ€™ll Learn
- How analog sensors work  
- How to use `analogRead()` and convert voltage to real-world units  
- How to send sensor data to the computer using `Serial.println()`

## ðŸŽµ Project 2 â€” Buzzer Melody Player

### Description
This project plays a short melody using a **passive buzzer** and the `tone()` function.  
It demonstrates how Arduino can generate sound frequencies and play simple tunes.

### Circuit Connections
- **Buzzer Positive (+)** â†’ Digital Pin 8 on Arduino  
- **Buzzer Negative (â€“)** â†’ GND on Arduino  

If you use a breadboard, make sure the longer leg of the buzzer (positive) goes to **pin 8**, and the shorter leg (negative) goes to **ground**.

### How It Works
- Each musical note is represented by a frequency defined in `pitches.h`  
- The `tone()` function sends a square wave to the buzzer at the desired frequency  
- `delay()` controls the duration and rhythm of the melody  
- `noTone()` stops the sound between notes to separate them clearly  

### What Youâ€™ll Learn
- How to generate audio tones with Arduino  
- How timing and rhythm are controlled using code  
- How musical notes correspond to electronic signal frequencies

## Project 3 â€” LED Fading with PWM and Oscilloscope

### Description
This project gradually increases and decreases the brightness of an LED using **Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)**.  
An oscilloscope can be connected to visualize how the PWM waveform changes as the LED fades in and out.

### Circuit Connections
- **LED Anode (long leg)** â†’ Digital Pin 5 (PWM pin)  
- **LED Cathode (short leg)** â†’ One end of a 220Î© resistor  
- **Other end of the resistor** â†’ GND on Arduino  
- **Oscilloscope probe** â†’ Connected across the LED (or between Pin 5 and GND) to observe the PWM waveform  

### How It Works
The Arduinoâ€™s `analogWrite()` function rapidly switches the LED pin ON and OFF at different ratios (duty cycles).  
The higher the duty cycle, the longer the LED stays ON during each cycle â€” making it appear brighter.  
As the duty cycle decreases, the LED appears dimmer.

### What Youâ€™ll Learn
- How PWM simulates analog voltage using digital output  
- How LED brightness is controlled smoothly through software  
- How to visualize PWM signals on an oscilloscope
