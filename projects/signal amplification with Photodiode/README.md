# Arduino Photodiode Light Sensor System

## Introduction
A **photodiode** is a semiconductor device that converts light energy (photons) into electrical energy (electrons). When exposed to light, it generates a small current or voltage that can be amplified and measured. Small photodiodes are typically used for **light intensity sensing**, while large-area photodiodes are used for **solar power generation**.

In this project, we will be using the **BPW34 Photodiode** with an **Op-Amp conditioning circuit** and **Arduino** to build a light-intensity measurement system.

## Project Scope

This project demonstrates:

- Using the **BPW34 Photodiode** in a **transimpedance amplifier (Op-Amp) circuit**
- Amplifying its response for **Arduino ADC measurement**
- Creating a functional and precise **light-intensity sensor**

The result provides a strong foundation for more advanced applications such as optical communication or directional light tracking.

## Photodiode Applications

Photodiodes are used in a wide range of optoelectronic systems including:

- Solar tracking systems
- Light intensity meters (Lux sensors)
- Position sensing modules
- Photo-interrupters and object detectors
- High-speed optical communication
- Medical sensors such as pulse detection
- Security laser alarms
